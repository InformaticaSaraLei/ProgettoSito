<div>    <p>The Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is the biggest student associations in Europe. It was born on the 16th October 1989 and legally registered in 1990 for supporting and developing student exchange.</p>
    <p>ESN works for the creation of a more mobile and flexible education environment by supporting and developing the student exchange from different levels, and providing an intercultural experience also to those students who cannot access a period abroad ("internationalisation at home").</p>
    <p>In Veneto there are only 3 sections of ESN:</p>
    <li><a href="http://www.esnpadova.it">Padova (AEP-ESN Padova)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.esnvenezia.it">Venezia (ESN Venezia Meet a Mate)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ase-esnverona.it">Verona (ASE ESN Verona)</a></li>
