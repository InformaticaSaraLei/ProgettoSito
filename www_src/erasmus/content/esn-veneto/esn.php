<div><p>The Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is the biggest student associations in Europe. It was born on the 16th October
        1989 and legally registered in 1990 for supporting and developing student exchange.</p>

    <p>ESN works for the creation of a more mobile and flexible education environment by supporting and developing the
        student exchange from different levels, and providing an intercultural experience also to those students who
        cannot access a period abroad ("internationalisation at home").</p>

    <p>In Veneto there are only 3 sections of ESN:</p>
    <li><a href="http://www.esnpadova.it">Padova (AEP-ESN Padova)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.esnvenezia.it">Venezia (ESN Venezia Meet a Mate)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ase-esnverona.it">Verona (ASE ESN Verona)</a></li>
