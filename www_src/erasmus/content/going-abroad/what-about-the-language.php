 <h2>Who can apply?</h2>
 <p>Students who have been selected for an Erasmus study/placement period in one of the organizing countries or regions have the opportunity to get to know their languages and cultures for two to six weeks with the aim of being prepared for the Erasmus mobility period. They may receive a supplementary mobility grant awarded and paid by their home institutions to help cover extra costs.</p>
  <p>Students whose main subject of study is the language of the country or region organizing the EILC are normally not eligible participants.</p>
  <p>Comenius and Grundtvig Assistants may also participate, provided that there is a surplus of places on a course.</p>
  <p>Students may not be charged a tuition fee for participation in an EILC course. However, fees may be charged for optional events.</p>
