    <h3>What is Erasmus?</h3>

    <p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/doc80_en.htm">ERASMUS programme</a> is a
        European student exchange programme established in 1987 offering university students a possibility of studying
        or working abroad in another European country for a period of at least 3 months and maximum 12 months. The name
        of the project refers to Dutch Renaissance humanist and theologian Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. He studied
        at diverse European universities and described the education as a chance for modern people.

    <p/>

    <p>Since 2007 the Erasmus project is a part of <a href="The Lifelong Learning Programme">The Lifelong Learning
            Programme</a> (other projects: Comenius, Grundtvig and Leonardo da Vinci), which is determined for the years
        2007-2013.</p>
